#Make sure to replace 'sample_data.csv' with the actual path to your CSV file 
#and 'column_name' and 'categorical_column' with the names of the columns you want to analyze.

import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('sample_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(data.head())

# Get summary statistics of numeric columns
summary_stats = data.describe()
print(summary_stats)

# Calculate the mean of a specific column
mean_column = data['column_name'].mean()
print(f"Mean of 'column_name': {mean_column:.2f}")

# Count the occurrences of values in a categorical column
value_counts = data['categorical_column'].value_counts()
print(value_counts)

#This code snippet demonstrates loading data, displaying the first few rows, calculating summary statistics, calculating the mean of a specific column, 
and counting occurrences of values in a categorical column. 
You can further customize and expand this code to perform more in-depth analysis based on your dataset and research goals.
